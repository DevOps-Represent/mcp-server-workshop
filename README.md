# üß† Build an AI Backend: Tools, Memory & Prompts for Real-World LLMs

Welcome to the workshop! In this hands-on session, you'll learn how to build and deploy an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** ‚Äî the backend brain behind AI clients like assistants, copilots, and autonomous agents.

Using the open-source **TypeScript or Python MCP SDK** and **Claude**, you‚Äôll create a system that gives an LLM memory, tool access, and structured prompts ‚Äî and deploy it live using **Cloudflare**.

No prior AI experience needed ‚Äî just Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and curiosity!

By the end of this workshop, you will:

- Understand what an **MCP Server** is and how it powers AI systems
- Use the MCP SDK to:
  - Register and expose tools (functions) to an AI model
  - Manage context and memory for stateful conversations
  - Orchestrate prompts and responses between clients and Claude
- Run and test your MCP server locally
- **Deploy your MCP server to Cloudflare** using Workers or Pages Functions so others can use it too
